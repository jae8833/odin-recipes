    <p>Essentially, dak galbi / dakgalbi (닭갈비) is spicy chicken stir fried 
       in a large pan, which is often a cast iron pan.</p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>500g /1.1 pounds chicken thigh fillets</li>
        <li>1/2 medium sweet potato (180g/6.3 ounces)</li>
        <li>1/2 small carrot (60g/2.1 ounces), diagonally sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 small cabbage (320g/0.7 pounds), shredded</li>
        <li>10 Korean perilla leaves (35g/1.2 ounces), thinly sliced</li>
        <li>18 fresh Korean rice cakes pieces (175g/ 6.1 ounces)</li>
        <li>Some cooking oil (2 to 3 Tbsp) – I used rice bran oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and mix them well.</li> 
        <li>Pour the sauce over the chopped chicken and marinate for at least 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large skillet on medium high heat and once heated add some 
            cooking oil.</li> 
        <li>Put all the vegetables and rice cakes into the skillet and add the meat 
            on top. Cook them on medium high heat for 3-4 mins.</li> 
        <li>Then reduce the heat to medium to medium low and cook further until all 
            is cooked (about 10 - 15 mins).</li> 
        <li>During cooking, stir often to avoid food sticking onto the pan.</li> 
            You can cover with a lid to speed up the cooking process.</li>
    </ol>
